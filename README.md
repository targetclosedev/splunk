splunk
======

Splunk is a big data tool using which one can fetch large volume data in no time. It is indexing based tool where each incoming data is indexed into buckets namely hot bucket, cold bucket and frozen. 
It supports connecting to DBs hence once can easily dump their OLTP data into Splunk and then later use it to retrieve data faster for historic range too.
